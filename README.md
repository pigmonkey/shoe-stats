# Shoe Stats

A personal database of shoe sizes and weights.

Shoe sizing varies so widely that [I find it necessary to maintain a database of sizes in order to succesfully purchase shoes online](https://pig-monkey.com/2021/05/shoe-stats/).

Unless otherwise noted, all widths are whatever the brand considers to be "standard".

Weights are all "as worn" -- meaning they are what I measured after replacing shoe laces (probably with [Lawson Toughlaces](https://lawsonequipment.com/Technora-Toughlaces-p1080.html)) or insoles.
